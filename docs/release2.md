# SUBMISSION 2

After some good feedback from release 1, we have improved out coding quality and changed  our working method, for a better work flow. Most importantly we use branches, when its needed. 
## FUNCTIONALITY:
The application is now fully functional with a database that saves the stocks you buy. You can also sell these stocks for their real value. The only problems are minor and will be fixed in no time.

## Test files:
After som time trying to get jacoco to work we have finally completed it. All the java files now have a test class. We have had some problem with modules that did not let us test some of the code, which we now have fixed.

## JAVA FXML:
We have now changed the UI for the whole app so it looks more like the sketch we made for the app.

## Temporary solutions
We have uncovered some spotbugs that we were not able to effectively solve yet, so we are currently using some temporary solutions while we find something more elegant, such as the static variables in "StonkApp.java".
