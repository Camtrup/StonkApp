# SUBMISSION 2

After some good feedback from release 1, we have improved out coding quality and changed  our working method, for a better work flow. Most importantly we use branches, when its needed. 
## FUNCTIONALITY:
The application is now fully functional with a database that saves the stocks you buy. You can also sell these stocks for their real value. The only problems are minor and will be fixed in no time.

## Test files:
After som time trying to get yackoko to work we have finally done it. All the java files now have a test class. We have had some problem with modules that did not let us test some of the code, which we now have fixed.

## JAVA FXML:
We have now changed the UI for the whole app so it looks more like the sketch we made for the app.
