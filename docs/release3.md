The app is now done!

Stonk is now a fully functional paper trading app with hashed password(#40). The functions the app now includes are log inn, logg out, delete  user, register new account, buy and sell stocks, wishlist(#41), add more money(#28), show equity/cashBalance(#44) and exit buttons(#25).

This is also when we finally added an REST API for securing and saving the data of our users on a server. This was done by upgrading the application to be spring based, with the use of spring-boot. (#29 , #39)
To really get that clean and good code quality, we used Checkstyle(#37). It helped us keep up with the coding standards and made the code more readable. The last weeks of the project were mostly used of updating the documentation and improving the code and test quality.

The use of Pair programming was still useful even if we hadd less meetings than when we started, but still over our minimum requirements we set in our contract. The use of issues with labels and boards on Gitlab was useful when we did not meet the group ass often ass in Milestone 1.
