# Stonk!

In this section we will write about how the code is built, everything from which libraries we are using to illustrations and the thoughts behind the code.

## JSoup
**Stonk** is built with the library [JSoup](https://jsoup.org). Jsoup allows us to scrape and parse data from a website using DOM traversal and CSS selectors. 
Using this we are able to get information about every given stock in real-time.
