# CORE

## What is CORE:
Core contains the central logic of the app and is where we have our two main java classes Stonk.java and User.java. It is completely independent of the UI.

- User.java is where the user credentials are made.
- Stonk.java is the class that gets the information about the stock you want to look for by web scraping the web page matketwatch.
- This is where you can find theese files.
